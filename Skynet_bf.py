"""Software for planning of nightshifts of doctors at my Hospital.

   Status: allways finds a solution. Can miss a best solution.

   The software creates an optimal pattern of nightshifts for doctors based on 
   their preference (ie. they can say which days they would love to work and 
   on which days they dont want or can not work).

   The method is a genetic algorithm.
   The input is a time span in format of 2018-01-01 to 2018-01-31 for example.
   The input are text files:

   docold.txt - a list of all names of all senior doctors
   docyoung.txt - a list of all names of all junior doctors
   svatky.txt - a list of days which are like weekend days due to holiday
   *.txt - each name from docold or docyoung has an appropriate .txt file

   Config files for each worker in this format.
   1 - number of workdays or X, where X will distribute evenly among X
   2 - number of weekends or X
   3 - employment (0.5 could mean to expect half the workdays and weekends)
   4 - minimal interval between nightshifts
   5 - number of days with index 1 - deprecated 
   6 - number of days with index 1.125 - deprecated
   7 - number of days with index 1.25 - not used atm
   8 - number of days with index 1.3 - not used atm
   9 - number of days with index 1.37 - not used atm
   12 - list of days on which the workers WANTS to work
   13 - keyword NEMUZE marking the end of WANTED days
   14 - list of days on which the worker DOESNT want to work
